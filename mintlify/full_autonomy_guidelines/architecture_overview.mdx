OM1â€™s full autonomy mode is powered by the following tightly integrated services, each running in its own container and communicating in real time:

- **om1**: The agentic software that controls robot behavior, decision-making, and high-level autonomy.
- **unitree_go2_ros2_sdk**: Provides SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), navigation, and sensor integration for the Unitree Go2 robot. It manages sensor data, mapping, and robot movement.
- **om1-avatar**: A React-based frontend that runs on the BackPack screen, offering a user interface and real-time avatar display for monitoring and interaction.

## How the System Works

1. **Sensor Data Collection**  
   The `unitree_go2_ros2_sdk` gathers data from sensors such as LiDAR and cameras, publishing ROS2 topics for localization and mapping.

2. **Autonomous Decision-Making**  
   The `om1` agent receives processed sensor data, user and system prompts, system governance and issues commands for navigation, exploration, and interaction, enabling the robot to operate independently.

3. **Continuous Monitoring**  
   The `watchdog` service within the ROS2 SDK monitors sensor and topic health, automatically restarting components if issues are detected to ensure reliability.

4. **User Interaction**  
   The `om1-avatar` frontend displays robot avatars, allowing you to interact with your robot in real time via the BackPack screen. It is designed to work in conjunction with OM1 robotics backend systems and hardware components.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repositories

Clone the following repositories:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/OpenMind/OM1.git
```
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/OpenMind/unitree_go2_ros2_sdk.git
```
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/OpenMind/OM1-avatar.git
```

### 2. Start All Services

Open a terminal in each repository directory and run:

- **OM1**
  ```bash
  cd OM1
  docker-compose up om1 -d --no-build
  ```

- **unitree_go2_ros2_sdk**
  ```bash
  cd unitree_go2_ros2_sdk
  docker-compose up orchestrator -d --no-build
  docker-compose up om1_sensor -d --no-build
  docker-compose up watchdog -d --no-build
  ```

- **OM1-avatar**
  ```bash
  cd OM1-avatar
  docker-compose up om1_aatar -d --no-build
  ```

## What Happens Next

- The BackPack screen will launch the OM1-avatar frontend, providing a live interface for robot status and control.
- The robot will begin autonomous operation, navigating, mapping, and learning from its environment.
- You can now interact with your robot through the user interface.

Your robot is now ready to accompany you, assist with tasks, explore new environments, and learn alongside you.
