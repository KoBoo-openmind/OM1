Once the Go2 is setup to run in full autonomy, you can get started with exploring different modes offered via OM1 and explore the functionalities.
There are two ways to do this:
1. Voice commands
2. Via Portal

## Voice commands

Start talking to your robot dog and ask it to switch to a particular mode.

## Portal

- Login to your OM1 portal and head over to Machine Teleops on the left navigation bar.
