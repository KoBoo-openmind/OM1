## What are modes?
Modes define the primary behavioral state and functional context of the OM1 system.
Each mode adjusts how OM1 perceives its environment, processes user inputs, and prioritizes tasks. By switching modes, OM1 can dynamically transition between social interaction, exploration, patrol, or autonomous operation based on user intent or system triggers.

Modes can be user-selected (via voice commands or UI).

## Modes Supported within OM1 for Unitree Go2 Currently

- Welcome mode - Initial greeting and user information gathering
- Slam mode - Autonomous navigation and mapping mode
    - Enables OM1 to explore and map its surroundings using its sensors.
    - Builds and updates internal maps for navigation and spatial awareness.
    - Typically used during setup, or when mapping new areas
- Guard mode - Patrol and security monitoring mode
    In Guard Mode, OM1 performs scheduled or continuous patrols within a defined area. It uses onboard sensors and AI models to detect unusual activity, monitor for movement, or respond to security alerts. Designed for reliability and alertness, Guard Mode operates with high autonomy but can notify human operators when needed.
    Key Functions:
    - OM1 performs patrol routines within a defined area.
    - Monitors for motion or unusual activity during patrols.
    - Reports its status and logs key events during operation.
- Conversation mode - Focused conversation and social interaction mode
    - OM1 engages in direct communication with the user.
    - Focused on natural dialogue and maintaining user attention.
- Navigation mode - Autonomous navigation mode
    - OM1 moves between defined points within a mapped area.
    - Uses existing maps (from Slam Mode) for pathfinding.
    - Avoids obstacles and ensures safe movement to the target location.
